abstract
Stock price prediction is an important topic in finance and economics which has spurred the interest of researchers over the years to develop better predictive models. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been explored in literature for time series prediction. This paper presents extensive process of building stock price predictive model using the ARIMA model. Published stock data obtained from star bucks are used with stock price predictive model developed. Results obtained revealed that the ARIMA model has a strong potential for short-term prediction. Stock market or Share market is one of the most complicated and sophisticated way to do business. Small ownerships, brokerage corporations, banking sector, all depend on this very body to make revenue and divide risks; a very complicated model. However, this paper proposes to use machine learning algorithm to predict the future stock price for exchange by using opensource libraries and pre-existing algorithms to help make this unpredictable format of business a little more predictable. We shall see how this simple implementation will bring acceptable results. The outcome is completely based on numbers and assumes a lot of axioms that may or may not follow in the real world so as the time of prediction.
